Result of using code interpreter:
1. upload CSV file [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)
2. prompt `share code to train a Keras model on this dataset where the trained model would be able to predict whether a given listing would have a price above or below the average price`
